Project 2 for CS 3300: Game of Thrones


Ajay
1. Create vertical timeline based on our 1-20 frames but scaled to the time between the start of the war of the five kings
298 to 301.
2. map the events chronologically next to the timeline as clickable events that then switch where the current position
in the timeline is to when that event occurs. Pops up modal of information of that event and positions the armies
at that time slice

3. make each army a different color and make each one have their emblem at the center.

4. potentially as a stretch goal figure out how to show the influence of each party over time as well. seperate
from the army data. this is why regards to allegiances.
